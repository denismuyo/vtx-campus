    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      VersaTechX Campus was born from a simple but powerful idea — to empower African youth with digital skills that spark innovation, boost confidence, and open up global opportunities.
      Founded in 2025 by Denis Nzioka Muyo, a passionate tech innovator and visionary, VersaTechX Campus started with a clear mission: to make quality tech education accessible, practical, and impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand the challenges faced by many young people across the continent — limited resources, under-resourced schools, and a lack of mentorship. VersaTechX is the bridge that connects raw talent with the tools of tomorrow.
      Through fast-track, project-based learning and personalized support, we help learners not only master software tools like Adobe Photoshop but also turn their skills into income, impact, and independence.
